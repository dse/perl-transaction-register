# In this example, your balances would be:
#
#               8218.10       - ledger balance (includes just the posted
#                               transactions)
#               8152.12       - pending balance (adds the pending
#                               transactions)
#               8049.16       - running balance (adds the transactions
#                               you've made but not yet marked as
#                               pending or posted)
#               9268.13       - future balance (also includes transactions
#                               marked with the future flag, i.e., you
#                               plan to make them but haven't yet done so)
#
# This is a quick-and-dirty text-based format for checkbook registers.
#
# Blank lines, lines containing only whitespace, and lines starting with
# optional whitespace then '#' are ignored.
#
# Transactions specify the date, then the amount, then a description field.
# They can optionally start with optional whitespace followed by a flag:
#
#       /       posted to your account
#       -       pending - listed as "pending" in your account
#       +       future - transactions you haven't made yet
#
# Dates are specified in one of the following formats:
#
#       06/20/2017
#       06/20
#       2017-06-20
#       06-20
#
# You must specify two digits for the month and day, and if you specify the
# year it must be four digits.  day-then-month-then-year formats are not
# supported.  If the year is not specified it is relative to the previously
# specified transaction date or the starting-date.
#
# With account-type = checking, transaction amounts are normally debits.
# In parentheses they are credits.  Dollar signs are optional.
# Two-digit cents are required.
#
# To specify a check, start the description field with '#<number>' or
# '#<number>:' specifying the check number.
# 
# [preauth] amounts in the description field are mainly used to confirm your
# pending balance which will account for the preauth amount, not the final
# amount.  For restaurant transactions, preauth amounts don't include tips.
#
# There is code in My::Transaction::Register that supports things I did not
# mention here.
